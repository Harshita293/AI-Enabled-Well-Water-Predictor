# AI-Enabled Well Water Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-enabled system that predicts well water availability using machine learning models based on environmental, geological, and historical parameters.

The system helps in:
- Identifying suitable locations for wells
- Predicting water yield and success probability
- Supporting sustainable groundwater management

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional methods of predicting well water availability are manual, time-consuming, and often inaccurate. This project uses machine learning to provide faster and more reliable predictions.

---

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, ensemble models  
- **Data:** Groundwater and environmental datasets
